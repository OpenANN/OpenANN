This is the API documentation of OpenANN.

OpenANN is an open source library for artificial neural networks. It is open
for users that want to apply ANN to their problems, developers and researchers
that want to implement new technologies and students that want to understand
the tricks that are required to implement neural networks. It follows a
minimal dependency policy, i.e. we rely on only a few libraries and tools.

To start using OpenANN it might be helpful to take a look at
\ref GettingStarted to see how it works.

\section Applications

OpenANN has been used to

- develop a new network compression technique based on compressed sensing that
can be used for supervised as well as for reinforcement learning [1]
- examine invariant pattern recognition approaches with constrained higher
order nodes
