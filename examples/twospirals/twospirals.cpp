 * \section DataSet Data Set
 *
 * This is a classification benchmark which is particularly difficult for
 * gradient descent optimization.
 *
 * The two spirals data set was developed by Lang and Witbrock [1]. The data
 * set we use here is taken from the
 * <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/neural/bench/0.html" target=_blank>
 * CMU Neural Networks Benchmarks</a>. It consists of 193 training instances
 * and 193 test instances located on a 2D surface. They belong to one of two
 * spirals:

 *
 * \section NetworkArchitecture Network Architecture
 *
 * It is possible to solve this problem with one or two hidden layers. But
 * architectures with two hidden layers need less connections and can learn
 * faster. The architecture we chose here is 2-20-20-1 with bias. You can solve
 * this problem with different compression setups. the smallest number of
 * parameters that reliably solves this problem is 3-6-1 with orthogonal cosine
 * functions. All activation functions are tangens hyperbolicus (MLP::TANH). The
 * best optimization algorithm is Levenberq-Marquardt (MLP::BATCH_LMA).
 *
 * \section UI User Interface
 *
 * You can use the following keys to control the program:
 *  - Q: Toggle display of training set
 *  - W: Toggle display of test set
 *  - E: Toggle display of predicted classes for the whole surface
 *  - R: Toggle display of smooth prediction transitions (black+white or grey)
 *  - A: Start visible training
 *  - Escape: Quit application.
 *
 * A trained model could make these predictions:
