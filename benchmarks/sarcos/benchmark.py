## \page SARCOSBenchmark SARCOS Inverse Dynamics Problem
#
#  The SARCOS dataset is taken from
#  <a href="http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/data/" target=_blank>this</a>
#  website. This is an inverse dynamics problem, i.e. we have to predict the
#  7 joint torques given the joint positions, velocities and accelerations.
#  Hence, we have to solve a regression problem with 21 inputs and 7 outputs
#  and a very nonlinear function.
#
#  The optimization problem is very hard. Underfitting is a much bigger
#  problem than overfitting. For this reason, we need a very big network
#  that has four hidden layers with 200 nodes each. The deep architecture
#  makes the optimization problem very hard but it is more efficient than a
#  shallow network. However, we can do two things to increase the optimization
#  speed drastically: we use a non-saturating activation function (rectified
#  linear units) and mini-batch stochastic gradient descent.
#
#  You can start the benchmark with the script:
#  \verbatim
#  python benchmark.py [download] [run]
#  \endverbatim
#  Note that you need SciPy to load the dataset and matplotlib to display some
#  results.
#
#  The output will look like
#  \verbatim
#  Dimension 1: nMSE = 0.938668% (training) / 0.903342% (validation)
#  Dimension 2: nMSE = 0.679012% (training) / 0.647091% (validation)
#  Dimension 3: nMSE = 0.453497% (training) / 0.442720% (validation)
#  Dimension 4: nMSE = 0.242476% (training) / 0.240360% (validation)
#  Dimension 5: nMSE = 1.010049% (training) / 1.044068% (validation)
#  Dimension 6: nMSE = 0.851110% (training) / 0.796895% (validation)
#  Dimension 7: nMSE = 0.474232% (training) / 0.465929% (validation)
#  \endverbatim
#  You see the normalized mean squared error (nMSE) for each output dimension
#  on the training set and the test set. The nMSE is the mean squared error
#  divided by the variance of the corresponding output dimension. In addition,
#  a plot that compares the actual and the predicted output of one dimension
#  will occur.
